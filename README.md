#JS30 CSS-VARIABLES
Exorcise 03 in WesBos' JavaScript tutorials.

CSS & JS together are extremely powerful, and this is only the tip of the iceberg. I like how Wes demonstrated how to handle the suffix that some css values require. 

In this tutorial I learned the differences between a Node List and an Array, such that an array has far more prototypes, but they are continually updated this i.e. Node List getting the forEach() method.

I had quite a lot of fun taking this a bit further and implementing a random button for each of the sliders as well. I'm sure there are many ways to do this, I ended up using the "id" property in combination with if/else statements to isolate buttons from sliders (random from selected values)
